# Design pattern guide

there are a total of three types of design patterns

[creational](#creational-design-patterns)

[structural](#structural-design-patterns)

[behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

## creational-design-patterns

+ ### builder

#### when we might need to use builder design pattern?
When creating objects with many optional parameters that can result in a large number of constructor overloads

When the object being created is complex and requires a step-by-step process to set its properties

When the object's properties need to be immutable after creation

When there is a need for consistency and standardization in the creation of objects with multiple parameters

#### what are the benefits of builder design pattern?

Allows for the creation of complex objects with many optional parameters in a more readable and maintainable way

Ensures that the ordering of parameters does not affect object creation, as each parameter is explicitly set by the builder

Facilitates the creation of immutable objects by setting parameters once during object construction

Encourages consistency and standardization in object creation by providing a clear and consistent interface for building objects

+ ### factory method

+ ### abstract factory

+ ### prototype

+ ### singleton

+ ### object pool
